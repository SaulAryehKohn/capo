<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
<p>Visibilities or baseline listings are extracted from the database written by
the correlator recieve script.  Once oCAPO is pointed at the correct database its
internal visibility index can be updated by clicking <b>Update</b> near the top of the
page.  This update only needs to be performed when the database is changed or
the correlator is reconfigured.</p>
<p>
The visibility listing is displayed in a grid on the <b>Home</b> view.  The listing
may be filtered by antenna number, polerization etc using the <b>Filters</b> to the
right of the visibility table. Create or modify filters as necessary. Only one
is applied at a time. Refresh the page (ctrl-R) to apply the changes to the visibility
listing. <b>Select "streaming" mode to automatically update page</b>
</p>
<p>Use the trace option to plot logged <b>average</b> values. <i>Loggin status is
indicated in the upper-right corner of the dashboard.</i> Activate logging by navigating to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd ~/CAPO_online/CAPO_dashboard/
<br>and then starting the update daemon with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;python manage.py update [dbid]
<br>where the dbid is 1 for beestrong and 2 for beetrue. (This interface will be improved in next cycle.)

</p>
<p>
Click on a visibility in the table to see a plot of the correlator output. Change
the properties of the plot using the table at the right. This function hits the
database every time it is generated. To monitor a baseline, simply refresh the page.
</p>
<p>
Add a correlator database by going into the <b>Admin</b> interface and navigating
to the <b>Corr DBs</b> listing and clicking <b>add corr db</b>. <i>Database selection is currently 
limited to those in /var/www</i>
</p>
